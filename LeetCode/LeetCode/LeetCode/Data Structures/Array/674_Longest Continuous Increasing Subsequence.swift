// Description:
// Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest continuous increasing subsequence (subarray).
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [1,3,5], its length is 3.
//Even though [1,3,5,7] is also an increasing subsequence, it's not a continuous one where 5 and 7 are separated by 4.
//Example 2:
//
//Input: [2,2,2,2,2]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: The longest continuous increasing subsequence is [2], its length is 1.
//Note: Length of the array will not exceed 10,000.
