# You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and j.
# Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts a bit j ad ends at bit i.
# You can assume that the bits j through j have enough space to fukk all of M.
# That is, if M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i.
# You would not, for example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between
# bit 3 and bit 2
# Example:
# Input: N = 10000000000, M = 10011, i = 2, j = 6
# Output:N = 10001001100
