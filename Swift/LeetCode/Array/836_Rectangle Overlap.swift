//
// Description:
// A rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of its top-right corner.
//
//Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive.  To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.
//
//Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether they overlap.
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
//Output: true
//Example 2:
//
//Input: rec1 = [0,0,1,1], rec2 = [1,0,2,1]
//Output: false
//Notes:
//
//Both rectangles rec1 and rec2 are lists of 4 integers.
//All coordinates in rectangles will be between -10^9 and 10^9.
//
