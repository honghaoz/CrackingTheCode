// Description:
// Winter is coming! Your first job during the contest is to design a standard heater with fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.
//
//Now, you are given positions of houses and heaters on a horizontal line, find out minimum radius of heaters so that all houses could be covered by those heaters.
//
//So, your input will be the positions of houses and heaters seperately, and your expected output will be the minimum radius standard of heaters.
//
//Note:
//
//Numbers of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 25000.
//Positions of houses and heaters you are given are non-negative and will not exceed 10^9.
//As long as a house is in the heaters' warm radius range, it can be warmed.
//All the heaters follow your radius standard and the warm radius will the same.
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: [1,2,3],[2]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
//
//
//Example 2:
//
//Input: [1,2,3,4],[1,4]
//Output: 1
//Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
