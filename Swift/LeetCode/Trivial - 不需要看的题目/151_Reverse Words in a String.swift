// Description:
// Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: "the sky is blue"
//Output: "blue is sky the"
//Example 2:
//
//Input: "  hello world!  "
//Output: "world! hello"
//Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
//Example 3:
//
//Input: "a good   example"
//Output: "example good a"
//Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
//
//
//Note:
//
//A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
//Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
//You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
//
//
//Follow up:
//
//For C programmers, try to solve it in-place in O(1) extra space.
