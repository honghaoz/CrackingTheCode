//Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
//
//You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.
//
//Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
//
//For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
//
//For example,
//words: ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
//L: 16.
//
//Return the formatted lines as:
//[
//"This    is    an",
//"example  of text",
//"justification.  "
//]
//Note: Each word is guaranteed not to exceed L in length.
